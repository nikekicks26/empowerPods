# empowerPods

## created for ChimeHack4

### Inspiration

Inspired by the difficulties of refugee girls in finding a community and continuing their education, we developed EmpowerPods to create a community of girls that can connect

### 

### Design considerations

-EmpowerPods connect girls to a structured learning environment that encourages collaboration with other girls and women in their community and discovering of the self

-Girls film videos sharing in their own words what they are learning, interviews of other girls and women in their connunity and other activities. These videos are shared with other pods connecting these communities of girls learning about the same thing.

-In circumstances where there is limited or no internet connection availible, the pods have stored content which can continue to engage and educate girls. When internet becomes available, videos that the girls have selected to share are sent to the other pods.

### Challenges we ran into while building it

None of us have Android phones, wanted to be able to sync wirelessly, can't auto add girls to facebook groups, trying to account for every difficulty the girls face: location, language, community, accessibility

### Accomplishments we're proud of

FIguring out how to identify different phones that connect to the computer, developing a really slick UI and good idea, 

### How we built it

We built this with Love, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
